Abstract : 
Predicting stock market prices has been an area of interest ever since mathematical models started rolling out with each and every improvements getting us closer to an accuracy that very much allows us to perform high latency trading with minimal human intervention. Our work uses LSTM based prediction model which gives us the future stock prices and a MPC based model that gives the decisions that need to performed with the help of the predicted values. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for processing sequential data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most successful RNNs architectures.They are able to grasp data dynamically over time with high prediction accuracy. The MPC model then uses this predicted stock price and decides on the best decisions that will lead to maximum profit.
